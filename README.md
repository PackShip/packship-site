## What Is PackShip?

PackShip is an **open‑source** CLI tool that automates the entire npm package lifecycle—initialization, configuration, testing, versioning, and publishing—so you can ship in seconds, not days.

Whether you're just releasing your first package or you're a veteran looking to eliminate repetitive setup, PackShip streamlines your workflow.

---

## Key Features

- **`packship init`** – One command to scaffold a fully configured npm package.  
- **Dependency Management** – Auto‑installs dependencies for JS/TS, bundlers, linters, and more.  
- **`packship publish`** – Build, bump, and publish in a single step.  
- **Templates** – Prebuilt project types (component library, API wrapper, CLI) coming soon.  
- **Telemetry & Analytics** – Opt‑in usage metrics to help us improve the tool.
